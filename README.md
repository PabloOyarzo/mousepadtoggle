# mousepadtoggle
mousepadtoggle is a bash script that toggles on and off your Touchpad with a shortcut.

## Why?
I usually use my mouse for work and else, but sometimes I have to do something quick and I have the mouse already in my backpack, so now I can do a simple shortcut do what I need to do and then put everything back.

## How to use it?
```
mkdir $HOME/.scripts/mousepadtoggle/
cd $HOME/.scripts/mousepadtoggle/
git clone https://github.com/PabloOyarzo/mousepadtoggle.git
```

Then add the shortcut to your system.
I personally like `Alt + X` with the command
```sh /home/`YourUserHere`/.scripts/mousepadtoggle/mousetoggle.sh```

## What's next?
* Add automatic shortcut Add
